### 100 days of algorithms

This repository contains source code to accompany [100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) challenge.

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches **100**.

If you are interested, here's the [intro to the series](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) and [all the articles](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/latest) sorted by date from the latest.

The challenge was quite fun and rough, as well. Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free. Do expect to see code written in haste. A code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

#### notes

* the codebase was developed using `Python 3.6`
